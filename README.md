# 365daysofCode

This repository consists of all sorts of code in various languages. We would like to collect programs on various programs for the same. 

**Opening a Pull Request**:  
If the project is on GitHub, here’s how to submit a pull request:   
   a) Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions here.)   
   b) Create a branch for your edits.   
   c) Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Closes #37.”)   
   d) Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.   
   e) Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.   
   f) Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.   

#Hacktoberfest 2020 
Hacktoberfest is a monthlong celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean.

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in their global community! Four quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

Completing 4 of them allows you to be eligible for a limited edition t-shit, created by them or you can also choose to plant a tree and the team will do it for you on your behalf.
